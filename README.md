For preprocessing MIDI files we used code from utils.py found [here](http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnrbm.html)

Direct download via this [link](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/deep/midi.zip)

For some example code to use this class refer to [Variational-Autoencoder](https://github.com/y0ast/Variational-Autoencoder), which uses largely the same structure.

Feel free to contact the authors for any questions regarding use of code, dataset etc.
